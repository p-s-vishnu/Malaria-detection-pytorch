# Malaria detection using PyTorch

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable. 

The purpose of the project is to implementation a solution for easy and early malaria diagnosis with high accuracy.
